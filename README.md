## Limits

> User access limits are set to allow reasonable daily usage. These limits will not allow further accesses to the web service for the remainder of the day. After midnight these will be reset to zero. There will be a 40,000 limit per day for the current and vehicle data and 10 accesses per day for the full schedule. (Users needing more than 40,000 per day must demonstrate their user base of more than this limit and provide monthly user reports.)
